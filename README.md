# Checkout JS SDK Example

This repository features a React example that uses [Bigcommerce's Checkout JS SDK](https://github.com/bigcommerce/checkout-sdk-js) to illustrate how to build custom checkout solution for a BigCommerce store.


## Getting Started

For a quick demo or to give the [Checkout JS SDK](https://github.com/bigcommerce/checkout-sdk-js) a try, you will need to add the following to the page where you want the checkout to render:

```html
<script src="https://cdn8.bigcommerce.com/s-wmv3nwatp6/content/main.js"></script>

<div id="checkout-app"></div>
```
